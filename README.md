# Internship_Projects
Hello! Welcome to the projects I have headed and completed during my summer internship.

"Project 1" relates to my final delivariable. I read in data, manipulated it, produced statistics, and created an algorithm that sorts through inputted accounts and returns those with outliers along with their cooresponding chart.
There is also different charts I have created to supplement additional information.

"BCS" represents a financial modeling program I created to take financial models at the country level and scale/automate them to be able to represent individual operations within different states.
